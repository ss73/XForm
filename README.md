# XForm
A Processing sketch for playing around with linear algebra. No library
functions for matrix manipulation are used - the core math is implemented
in the Matrix class. Implementation is not optimized for speed or memory
conservation.

## How to run
* Install processing: https://processing.org/
* Clone this repository and cd to XForm
* Run: processing XForm.pde

## 3D models
I have not produced any of the 3D models myself. You can find the original
versions here:
